# Cruncher
Cruncher is an application that crawls over [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com) informations about posts, stores data about authors, articles and provides a web API to consume it.

Why? This is a challenge for [Cheesecake Labs](https://ckl.io). Because I love this company and I need this job :)

Under construction =)
